update flilght

when you are done with the changes

them by the origincolum and get me back all the result

db.session.query (Flight, passenger).filter (Flight.id == Passenger.flight_id).all() // query from the flight table and the passenger table
and we going to filter it flight id needs to equal to paasenger flight id and we are gonna selecet everything from there.
